            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello! I'm Rajendra Paudyal, a PhD student in Computer Science Department at George Mason University. My research focuses on Next Generation Networks, Wireless Communication and Network Security, where I'm working to make intelligent, smart and robust network.</p>
            <p>Prior to my doctoral studies, I completed my Master's degree in Information and Communication Engineering from Tribhuvan University.</p>

        <section id="research-interests">
            <h2>Research Interests</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Next Generation Networks (5G/6G):</strong> 
                    My hands-on experience with the operation and maintenance of RAN infrastructure (2G, 3G, LTE) provides a solid foundation for research into 5G and 6G networks. During my time at Nepal Telecom, I gained deep insights into node creation, configuration, and network performance optimization. These tasks directly relate to 5G and 6G technologies, where network densification, enhanced capacity, and ultra-reliable low-latency communication are crucial. This experience positions me to explore next-generation radio access technologies, network slicing, and the evolving use cases of 6G, such as enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB), massive machine-type communications (mMTC), and ultra-reliable low-latency communications (URLLC).
                </li>
                <li><strong>Application of AI/ML in Wireless Networks:</strong> 
                    With extensive experience in network performance analysis, traffic optimization, and preventative maintenance, my research focuses on the application of artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) in wireless networks. By leveraging AI/ML, I can automate network management tasks such as fault detection, traffic prediction, and resource allocation. My hands-on skills with troubleshooting, performance analysis, and network optimization give me a unique advantage in building AI/ML models to enhance self-organizing networks (SON), enable predictive maintenance, and improve overall network efficiency.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Computer Networks:</strong> 
                    My role in managing private Autonomous Systems (AS) and configuring MPLS-LDP L2VPN and L3VPN services for secure data transmission across networks aligns with broader research in computer networking. The knowledge I've gained in routing policies, VPN configuration, and network element integration is directly applicable to investigating advanced topics like network virtualization, software-defined networking (SDN), and network function virtualization (NFV). These technologies are critical in the development of future internet architectures and next-generation networks.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Network Security:</strong> 
                    My experience in maintaining secure and efficient routing within Autonomous Systems and managing L2/L3 VPN services gives me strong practical knowledge of network security challenges. With the increasing importance of data protection, encryption, and network integrity, my research focuses on cybersecurity measures in complex, multi-layered networks. This includes securing 5G/6G networks, detecting intrusions, and implementing robust access control mechanisms to safeguard against threats. Additionally, my understanding of NMS (Network Management Systems) could lead to research into automated threat detection and real-time security monitoring.
